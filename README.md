search for specific words in text files from a directory.

the path of the directory is at line 8 and the word to be searched is at line 11. the default directory is "*C:\\Users\\ADM\\IdeaProjects\\word-search\\txts-folder*", and the default search word is "*a*".  
you can change it to whathever you want and can (and should) change the files at *txts-folder* or the path and the word(s) to be searched.

so, in the default example, every occurance of the word and its line on each text file at *txts-folder* will be in the output.
obs.: the search is case sensitive
